# Timepiece

## Goal
Create a React app displaying both an analog and digital clock, each showing the correct time.

At this stage, the time shown will rely on client's local machine being set to the correct time/timezone. My goal in future is to have greater control over the accuracy.

## To Do

- [ ] Refactor analog and digital clocks into separate components
